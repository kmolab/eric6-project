The Tab Nanny despises ambiguous indentation.  She knows no mercy.

tabnanny -- Detection of ambiguous indentation

For the time being this module is intended to be called as a script.
However it is possible to import it into an IDE and use the function
check() described below.

Warning: The API provided by this module is likely to change in future
releases; such changes may not be backward compatible.

This is a modified version to make the original tabnanny better suitable
for being called from within the eric6 IDE.

@exception ValueError The tokenize module is too old.

# Released to the public domain, by Tim Peters, 15 April 1998.

# XXX Note: this is now a standard library module.
# XXX The API needs to undergo changes however; the current code is too
# XXX script-like.  This will be addressed later.

#
# This is a modified version to make the original tabnanny better suitable
# for being called from within the eric6 IDE. The modifications are as
# follows:
#
# - there is no main function anymore
# - check function has been modified to only accept a filename and return
#   a tuple indicating status (1 = an error was found), the filename, the
#   linenumber and the error message (boolean, string, string, string). The
#   values are only valid, if the status equals 1.
