Word completion for the eric6 shell.

<h4>NOTE for eric6 variant</h4>

    This version is a re-implementation of rlcompleter
    as found in the Python3 library. It is modified to work with the eric6
    debug clients.

<h4>Original rlcompleter documentation</h4>

    This requires the latest extension to the readline module. The completer
    completes keywords, built-ins and globals in a selectable namespace (which
    defaults to __main__); when completing NAME.NAME..., it evaluates (!) the
    expression up to the last dot and completes its attributes.

    It's very cool to do "import sys" type "sys.", hit the
    completion key (twice), and see the list of names defined by the
    sys module!

    Tip: to use the tab key as the completion key, call

        readline.parse_and_bind("tab: complete")

    <b>Notes</b>:
    <ul>
    <li>
    Exceptions raised by the completer function are *ignored* (and
    generally cause the completion to fail).  This is a feature -- since
    readline sets the tty device in raw (or cbreak) mode, printing a
    traceback wouldn't work well without some complicated hoopla to save,
    reset and restore the tty state.
    </li>
    <li>
    The evaluation of the NAME.NAME... form may cause arbitrary
    application defined code to be executed if an object with a
    __getattr__ hook is found.  Since it is the responsibility of the
    application (or the user) to enable this feature, I consider this an
    acceptable risk.  More complicated expressions (e.g. function calls or
    indexing operations) are *not* evaluated.
    </li>
    <li>
    When the original stdin is not a tty device, GNU readline is never
    used, and this module (and the readline module) are silently inactive.
    </li>
    </ul>
